Sokoban is a famous puzzle game designed in 1981 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, and first published in December 1982. You have to place all crates over the targets, by pushing them. 

**[SOKO64](https://triqui.itch.io/soko64)** is the original version written by [Emanuele Feronato](https://www.emanueleferonato.com/) in [ugBASIC](https://ugbasic.iwashere.eu) and it was developed for the Commodore 64 target (`c64`). It includes **64 8x8 tricky levels** by David Skinner. All levels are unlocked from the beginning, for you to try them all. Solved levels will be marked with green.

**[SOKO64+](https://spotlessmin.itch.io/soko64plus)** is a new version of the same game by Marco Spedaletti: starting from that source code , in order to run on many ugBASIC's targets, with just **a single source code**.
